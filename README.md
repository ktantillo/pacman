pacman project 

Discription 

In this project we generate images of pacman. The code is used to alter the position and velocity of the pacmen. The images are designed to bounce off the walls upon collision. You need to make sure at least one pacman has been generated before the game can start. 

How to Run

Clone the files in the repo to your machine locally. Open the index.html file in the browser of your choice, Crome is recommended. Make sure to click the button to add pacmen to the screen. After that you can click he button to start the game and see their movement.  

Roadmap for the Future 

In future iterations I would like to see the pacmen respond differently as the collide into each other and not just the walls of the screen.
